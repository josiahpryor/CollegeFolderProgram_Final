# CollegeFolderProgram
This program is designed to connect with the user's brightspace account, extract class information from their profile, create class folders based off this information, and allow the user to sort existing files into these newly created college class folders.

## Brightspace
The user must be an active student or teacher associated with a brightspace (D2L) account. The "fetch classes" operation pulls class names based off of the current semester the user is enrolled in. Example: If it is Fall 2024, when I log into brightspace through this program, it will pull my fall 2024 classes.
