# CollegeFolderProgram
There are four main operations in this GUI college folder program: Fetch classes, create folders, find files, add files.

## Fetch classes
This operation opens a chrome-based browser with the brightspace login screen, specifically used at Shepherd University. Once proper credentials are entered, the user will be directed to their class homepage for a second before the browser closes. In this blip, this program is scraping the web content to automatically gather your class names for the current semester. Once gathered, they will appear in a text box for you to see.

## Create folders
Once classes have been gathered from brightspace, you may select a directory where this program will create base folders, e.g. Documents and Code, and create class named folders for each class in these base folders.

## Find files 
This opens a directory prompt for you to select a folder containing files you would like to sort into the class folders. Once selected, the names of these files will appear in a list box for you to select them.

## Add files
Not until class folders have been created can you begin sorting files. Once files have been imported, you may select the desired files you would like to sort. With drop downs above the list box, you can select the desired base and class folder path you would like to add your selected folders into.
